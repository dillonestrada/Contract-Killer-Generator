						<h1>Web Development Contract</h1>
						<p>Between us <span class="item name">company name</span> and you <span
								class="item customername">customer name</span></p>

						<h2>Summary:</h2>

						<div class="summary">
							<p>We&#39;ll always do our best to fulfil your needs and meet your expectations, but
								it&#39;s important to have things written down so that we both know what&#39;s what, who
								should do what and when, and what will happen if something goes wrong. In this contract
								you won&#39;t find any complicated legal terms or long passages of unreadable text.
								We&#39;ve no desire to trick you into signing something that you might later regret.
								What we do want is what&#39;s best for both parties, now and in the future.</p>
							<p>So in short;</p>
							<p>You (<span class="item customername">customer name</span>) are hiring us (<span
									class="item name">company name</span>) to <span class="item task">design and develop
									a web site</span> for
								the estimated total price of <span class="item total">total</span> as outlined in our
								previous correspondence. Of course it&#39;s a little more complicated, but we&#39;ll get
								to that.</p>
						</div>

						<div class="agree">
							<h2>What do both parties agree to do?</h2>
							<p>*You:* You have the authority to enter into this contract on behalf of yourself, your
								company or your organisation. You&#39;ll give us everything we need to complete the
								project as and when and in the format we need it. You&#39;ll review our work, provide
								feedback and approval in a timely manner too. Deadlines work two ways, so you&#39;ll
								also be bound by dates we set together. You also agree to stick to the payment schedule
								set out at the end of this contract.</p>
							<p>*Us:* We have the experience and ability to do everything we&#39;ve agreed with you and
								we&#39;ll do it all in a professional and timely manner. We&#39;ll endeavour to meet
								every deadline that&#39;s set and on top of that we'll maintain the confidentiality of
								everything you give us.</p>
						</div>

						<div class="nitty">
							<h2>Getting down to the nitty gritty</h2>

							<h3>Design</h3>

							<p>We create look-and-feel designs, and flexible layouts that adapt to the capabilities of
								many devices and screen sizes. We create designs iteratively and use predominantly HTML
								and CSS so we won&#39;t waste time mocking up every template as a static visual. We may
								use static visuals to indicate a look-and-feel direction (color, texture and
								typography.) We call that design atmosphere.&#39;</p>
							<p>You&#39;ll have plenty of opportunities to review our work and provide feedback.
								We&#39;ll share a link with you to view and interact with the website and have regular,
								possibly daily contact.
								If, at any stage, you&#39;re not happy with the direction our work is taking and feel
								that we can't meet your needs you can
								pay us in full for everything we&#39;ve produced until that point and cancel this
								contract.</p>
							<h3>Text content</h3>

							<p>We&#39;re not responsible for writing or inputting any text copy. If you&#39;d like us to
								write new content or input text for you, we can provide a separate estimate for that.
							</p>

							<h3>Photographs</h3>

							<p>You should supply graphic files in an editable, vector digital format. You should supply
								photographs in a high resolution digital format. If you choose to buy stock photographs,
								we can suggest stock libraries. If you&#39;d like us to search for photographs for you,
								we can provide a separate estimate for that.</p>

							<h3>Code base files</h3>

							<p>We generally deliver web page types developed from HTML5 markup, CSS2.1 + 3 stylesheets
								for styling,
								unobtrusive JavaScript for feature detection, poly-fills and behaviours, and Python for
								the backend API and logic.
								If your site has Shopify or Wordpress integration then the website will also include
								liquid or php files respectively.</p>

							<h3>Browser testing</h3>

							<p>Browser testing no longer means attempting to make a website look the same in browsers of
								different capabilities or on devices with different size screens. It does mean ensuring
								that a person&#39;s experience of a design should be appropriate to the capabilities of
								a browser or device.</p>

							<h3>Desktop browser testing</h3>

							<p>We test our work in current versions of major desktop browsers including those made by
								Google (Chrome), Microsoft (Edge), Mozilla Firefox and
								Opera.We won&#39;t test in other older
								browsers unless you specify otherwise. If you need an enhanced design for an older
								browser, we can provide a separate estimate for that.</p>

							<h3>Mobile browser testing</h3>

							<p>Testing popular small-screen devices is essential in ensuring that a person&#39;s
								experience of a design is appropriate to the capabilities of the device they&#39;re
								using. We test our work in:</p>
							<p>iOS: Safari, Google Chrome Android 10: Google Chrome, Firefox, Edge</p>
							<p>We currently don&#39;t test Blackberry, Opera Mini/Mobile, Windows Phone or other mobile
								browsers. If you need us to test using these, we can provide a separate estimate for
								that.</p>

							<h3>Technical support</h3>

							<p>We&#39;re not a website hosting company so we don&#39;t offer support for website
								hosting, email or other services relating to hosting. You may already have professional
								hosting and you might even manage that hosting in-house; if you do, great. If you
								don&#39;t, we can set up an account for you at one of our preferred hosting providers.
								We can set up your site on a server, plus any statistics software such as Google
								Analytics and we can provide a separate estimate for that. Then, the updates to, and
								management of that server will be up to you, unless you also contract me to do ongoing
								maintenance for your site. I can provide a separate estimate for that.</p>

							<h3>Changes and revisions</h3>

							<p>We know from experience that fixed-price contracts are rarely beneficial to you, as they
								often limit you to your earliest ideas. We don&#39;t want to limit your ability to
								change your mind. The price at the beginning of this contract is based on the length of
								time we estimate we&#39;ll need to accomplish everything you&#39;ve told us you want to
								achieve, but we&#39;re happy to be flexible. If you want to change your mind or add
								anything new, that won&#39;t be a problem as we&#39;ll provide a separate estimate for
								that.</p>

							<h3>Legal stuff</h3>

							<p>We can&#39;t guarantee that our work will be error-free and so we can&#39;t be liable to
								you or any third-party for damages, including lost profits, lost savings or other
								incidental, consequential or special damages, even if you&#39;ve advised us of them.
								Finally, if any provision of this contract shall be unlawful, void, or for any reason
								unenforceable, then that provision shall be deemed severable from this contract and
								shall not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions.</p>
							<p>Phew.</p>

							<h3>Copyrights</h3>

							<p>First, you guarantee that all elements of text, images or other artwork you provide are
								either owned by your good selves, or that you&#39;ve permission to use them.</p>
							<p>Then, when your final payment has cleared, copyright will be automatically assigned as
								follows:</p>
							<p>You&#39;ll own the visual elements that we create for this project. We&#39;ll give you
								source files and finished files and you should keep them somewhere safe as we&#39;re not
								required to keep a copy. You own all elements of text, images and data you provided,
								unless someone else owns them.</p>
							<p>We&#39;ll own the unique combination of these elements that constitutes a complete design
								and we&#39;ll license its use to you, exclusively and in perpetuity for this project
								only, unless we agree otherwise.</p>
							<!-- OWNING THE SOURCE FILES -->
							<p>We love to show off our work and share what we&#39;ve learned with other people, so we
								reserve the right, with your permission, to display and link to your project as part of
								our portfolio and to write about it on websites, in magazine articles and in books.</p>

							<h3>Payments</h3>

							<p>We&#39;re sure you understand how important it is as a small business that you pay the
								invoices that we send you promptly.</p>
							<p>You agree to stick tight to the following payment schedule.</p>
							<p><span class="item payment">Payment schedule</span></p>

							<h3>But where&#39;s all the horrible small print?</h3>

							<p>Just like a parking ticket, you can&#39;t transfer this contract to anyone else without
								our permission. This contract stays in place and need not be renewed. If for some reason
								one part of this contract becomes invalid or unenforceable, the remaining parts of it
								remain in place.</p>
							<p>Although the language is simple, the intentions are serious and this contract is a legal
								document under exclusive jurisdiction of United States courts.</p>

							<h3>The dotted line</h3>

								<tr>
									<td>&nbsp;</td>
									<td>&nbsp;</td>

									<td>Signed by and on behalf of <span class="item name">company name</span></td>
